<div><h1> Practical Applications </h1>
<h3>Syntax of every major programming language is modelled by context-free grammars</h3>
<p>Theory behind design ans construction of major parts of compiler such as Lexial Analyzers and Paarsers.</p>
<p>Lexical Analysis is the first phase of the compiler also known as a scanner. It converts the High level input program into a sequence of Tokens.</p>

<h1>Foundations of Computation</h1>
<h2>When developing solutions to real problems, we often confront the limitation of what software can do.</h2>
  <p># Undecidable things- there are programs, but no fast programs.</p>
  <p># Intractable things - there are programs, but no fast programs.</p>
  <h2>Turing Machines</h2> <p>, to understand the fundamental limits of computation.</h2>
  <p>a mathematical model of a hypothetical computing machine which can use a predefined set of rules to determine a result from a set of input variables.</p>

  <h1>Abstraction and a new way of thinking</h1>
  <p>Abstraction: Building a mathematical model that captures the essence of the system in the simplest possible way</p>
  <p>In this course, we will use formal definitions for abstrac models, and reason about properties of the model purely using the definitions.<p>
  <p>we will also learn how to formally prove these properties</p>

  <h1> Languages , Machines and Computation</h1>
  <h2> Languages and Machines are two parallel and independent ways to understand the foundadtions Computation.</h2>
  <h2>Machines</h2>
  <h3>Abstract Models which capture some fundamemtal aspect of computation.</h3>
  <p>Automatons are abstract models of machines that perform computations on an input by moving through a series of states or configurations. At each state of the computation, a transition function determines the next configuration on the basis of a finite portion of the present configuration.</p>
  <h3> We will study the following three classes of Machines:</h3>
  <p># Finite Memory : Finite Automata</p>
  <p># Finite Memory with stack: Pushdown Automata </p>
  <p># Unrestricted Memory: Turing Machines</p>
