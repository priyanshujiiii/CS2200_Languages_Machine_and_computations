<div><h1> Practical Applications </h1>
<h3>Syntax of every major programming language is modelled by context-free grammars</h3>
<p>Theory behind design ans construction of major parts of compiler such as Lexial Analyzers and Paarsers.</p>
<p>Lexical Analysis is the first phase of the compiler also known as a scanner. It converts the High level input program into a sequence of Tokens.</p>

<h1>Foundations of Computation</h1>
<h2>When developing solutions to real problems, we often confront the limitation of what software can do.</h2>
  <p># Undecidable things- there are programs, but no fast programs.</p>
  <p># Intractable things - there are programs, but no fast programs.</p>
  <h2>Turing Machines</h2> <p>, to understand the fundamental limits of computation.</h2>

  <h1>Abstraction and a new way of thinking</h1>
  <p>Abstraction: Building a mathematical model that captures the essence of the system in the simplest possible way</p>
  <p>In this course, we will use formal definitions for abstrac models, and reason about properties of the model purely using the definitions.<p>
  <p>we will also learn how to formally prove these properties</p>
